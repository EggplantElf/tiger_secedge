ex0:
contains all useful data


ex1:
train.conll09 contains 1168 SBR, 1046 SBE and 828 SBC (not accurate, should subtract those in test)


ex2:
train.conll09 has no SBC labels


ex5:
find and map in a pipeline, not successful


ex3:
direct train and test, without find and map, since there is no SBC, ex2 is too complex

ex9:
devide into 3 step pipeleine, find MA, find C, map RE, test accuracy between pred and auto on each step

ex10:
e step pipeline, test on final result

ex11:
use the SBC data from ex1 again

ex12:
use different featureset, test each step

ex13:
new gold data, final result

ex14:
new gold data, each step

ex15:
new feature, has 'wie', 'um'... each step
